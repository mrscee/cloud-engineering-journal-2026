# Cloud Engineering Journal (2026)

This repository is my ongoing cloud engineering learning journal as I work with the Level Up in Tech community and continue developing AWS and DevOps skills.

This repo will document:

- Hands-on labs and projects
- Weekly learning summaries
- Architecture diagrams
- Reflections and insights
- Tools and workflows I am adopting
