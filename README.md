# Cloud Engineering Journal (2026)

This repository is my ongoing cloud engineering learning journal as I work with a community of like minded engineers and continue developing AWS and DevOps skills.
This journal updates weekly throughout 2026 as I continue building cloud engineering skills in AWS, Terraform, and DevOps tooling.


This repo will document:

- Hands-on labs and projects
- Weekly learning summaries
- Architecture diagrams
- Reflections and insights
- Tools and workflows I am adopting

## Purpose

- Gain hands-on experience with AWS and related tools
- Build real cloud projects using industry practices
- Document learning in a consistent and trackable way
- Show technical progression for future opportunities

## Technologies & Tools

- AWS (EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Terraform (IaC)
- Linux & CLI tooling
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
- Additional tools as I advance (to be added)
