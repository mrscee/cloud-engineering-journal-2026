#  

This repository documents my hands-on journey transitioning into cloud engineering through real infrastructure work, system operations, and DevOps practices.

It serves as a living portfolio demonstrating how I design, build, test, and troubleshoot cloud-based systems while developing practical experience in AWS, Linux, and infrastructure automation.

My focus is on building production-relevant skills, including system observability, performance testing, automation, and infrastructure reliability.


# 📦 What This Repository Contains

- Hands-on cloud labs and engineering projects
- Infrastructure experiments and system troubleshooting scenarios
- Architecture diagrams and implementation notes
- Bash and automation workflows
- Performance and monitoring exercises
- Reflections and operational insights

Each project demonstrates real-world engineering thinking rather than theoretical learning.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build production-relevant cloud engineering skills
- Develop hands-on experience with AWS and DevOps tooling
- Document infrastructure experiments and outcomes
- Demonstrate technical growth and operational thinking
- Showcase practical experience for cloud engineering roles

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Technologies & Tools

* AWS — EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, CloudWatch
* Terraform — Infrastructure as Code
* Linux & CLI tooling — system operations and automation
* Bash scripting — monitoring and task automation
* Git & GitHub — version control and documentation
* VS Code — development environment

Additional technologies will be added as my work expands.

## 🌱 Background & Phase Transition

This journal continues from my foundational AWS training:

➡ https://github.com/mrscee/AWS-12-Week-Journey

That phase focused on AWS fundamentals and Terraform practice.
This repository documents my transition into applied cloud engineering work.

## 🧭 Current Direction

* Infrastructure automation
* System observability and monitoring
* Linux system operations
* Cloud reliability practices
* DevOps workflows

## 🔜 Next Steps

* Continue documenting hands-on projects
* Expand infrastructure automation work
* Build end-to-end cloud systems
* Implement CI/CD and DevOps pipelines
