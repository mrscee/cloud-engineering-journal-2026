# Week 01 — Leaving My "Comfort" Zone

**Dates:** January 4, 2026

## Summary

This first week was foundational and energizing. Coming together with other like-minded learners was a key piece I didn’t realize I was missing. Stepping out of my comfort zone is already paying off, and I can finally feel myself moving toward the things I’ve been wanting to pursue for a long time.

## What I Worked On

- Revisited core cloud concepts I’d seen before
- Strengthened my understanding of AWS global infrastructure
- Reviewed key components that make up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

> Since this cohort has its own structured learning path, I won’t be sharing detailed curriculum content here, but I will continue reflecting on concepts, progress, and outcomes.

## Key Concepts & AWS Services (High-Level)

- AWS global infrastructure (regions, AZs, networking backbone)
- VPC foundational building blocks

## Community & Collaboration

I also met a lot of new people who are just as excited as I am about what the future holds in the cloud space. Being in an environment full of motivated learners feels like the push I needed.

## Reflection

This week was a whirlwind in the best way possible. I learned, I stretched, and I stepped into the next phase of my cloud journey with more confidence than I had before. I’m looking forward to continuing in the weeks ahead.

## Next Week

- Continue building foundational knowledge
- Begin hands-on components as we progress
